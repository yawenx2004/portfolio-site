# About my project ğŸŒ±
[Deployed on Render here.](https://yawenx2004.onrender.com/)

Welcome to my Node.js portfolio! ğŸŒŸ This is where I showcase my projects, skills, and experiences as a web developer and UI/UX designer. ğŸŒ»ğŸŒ¿

This is absolutely still a work in progress (and I'm spending way too much time on this instead of my actual CS classes but it's been incredibly fun </3), but here are the current features as of 22 April 2024:

- **portfolio** (ğŸš§ under construction): built on a responsive grid layout; showcases my projects
- **resume**: here you can view and/or download a copy of my resume (last update sometime in April 2024)
- **about page**: contains an intro & weather data (retrieved from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)) of places I am from
- **"blog"** (ğŸš§ under construction): my "thoughts;" currently running on local storage, with a capacity of one (1) entry exactly; this can be edited through a password-protected internal page.

Directory structure:

- **index.js** is the entry point of my application
- **src** houses my HTML documents
- **style** houses my CSS file

# How to run on your local machine ğŸ’»
1. Clone repository from GitHub
2. Type the following commands into the terminal:
3. To test blog functionality, go to internal.html (scroll down; it's the bottom link on the footer), and type in the password; you will then be able to access the blog editor form.
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

# Demo ğŸš€
Deployed [here](https://yawenx2004.onrender.com/)!

Here is a quick run-down of how to test the blog functionality:

1. Click the link to the interal page (scroll down to the footer); you should see the password input prompt pictured below:
2. If you click cancel, you'll be directed to the home page; if you enter the wrong password, the form will refresh; if you enter the correct password, you'll be able to access /internal.
3. See changes reflected in /journal!

# Future features!! ğŸŒ 
### ğŸŒŸ dev ğŸŒŸ
- actully build each part of the portfolio
- host blog & portfolio entries in SQL database; currently everything is in local storage
- ~~deploy deploy deploy~~ Render's actually so easy to use once you actually watch a 2-minute video about it

### ğŸŒŸ des ğŸŒŸ
- remake the weather icons; right now I'm using the [default](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions), but I'd like to have versions that mesh better with the overall UI of the site
- draw my pfp, in the style of the strawberries icon; replace my photo on the about page with this art
- re-evaluate spacing & divider decisions
- footer UI
- ~~make buttons less wobbly! right now they push other elements around when I hover~~ fixed! just added an invisible border so sizes stay consistent
