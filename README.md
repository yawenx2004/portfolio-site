# About my project
This is my portfolio site! Still a work in progress, but I had/am having fun developing & designing it. As of 17 April 2024 it features my portfolio (under construction), my resume (also under construction), and a hidden internal page (under construction and I don't know what it's for but I like it).

When this site becomes more functional I intend to obtain a domain and make it my UI/UX design and web deve portolio.

- **index.js** is the entry point of my application
- **src** houses my HTML documents (or... i intend for it to once i update)
- **style** houses my CSS file

# Running instructions, locally

npm run dev
```

# Demo
You can find [here](https://yawenx2004.github.io/portfolio-site-static/index.html) an HTML-only preview of my website (since neither GitHub nor Render has allowed me to serve dynamic index.js files... I'll figure it out someday). It has limited functionality and as of 17 April 2024 I have stopped updating it concurrently with this repository.

This demo is notably missing the password-protection feature for internal.html.

I'll write more here later.
