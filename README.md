# Project description
This is my portfolio site! Still a work in progress, but I had fun developing it. Here's the [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/DFP1C6EUY8lsMVIzMR11hy/Portfolio?type=design&node-id=42%3A1336&mode=design&t=8zmoU2rdVaKycStl-1) where I designed this site before development.

# How to run locally
1. Clone repository from GitHub.
2. Type the following commands into the terminal:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
(NOT UP YET I'LL PUT THIS UP AND LINK IT WHEN I'M DONE) If you're here for my DALI dev application, click on the fourth tile of my portfolio to view my interpretation of the thematic website challenge.

Unfortunately GitHub is incompatible with Express. You can find a sad, skeletal, HTML-only version of the site with various images and documents missing, linked [here](https://yawenx2004.github.io/portfolio-site/).
