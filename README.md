# About my project
[demo (more on it later)](https://yawenx2004.github.io/portfolio-site-static/index.html)

This is my portfolio site! Still a work in progress, but I had/am having fun developing & designing it. As of 17 April 2024 it features my portfolio (under construction), my resume (also under construction), and a hidden internal page (under construction and I don't know what it's for but I like it).

When this site becomes more functional I intend to obtain a domain and make it my UI/UX design and web deve portolio.

- **index.js** is the entry point of my application
- **src** houses my HTML documents
- **style** houses my CSS file

# Instructions for running on your local machine
1. Clone repository from GitHub
2. Type the following commands into the terminal:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

# Demo
You can find [here](https://yawenx2004.github.io/portfolio-site-static/index.html) an HTML-only preview of my website (since neither GitHub nor Render has allowed me to serve dynamic index.js files... I'll figure it out someday). It has limited functionality and as of 17 April 2024 I have stopped updating it concurrently with this repository.

This demo is notably missing the password-protection feature for internal.html.

I'll write more here later.

# Future features?
- DALI developer challenge — I'll have it in my portfolio section
- need to figure out what goes on the password-protected page
- scroll detection — I'd like to try some cool things with it
